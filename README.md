For those that wish to review the content we talked about, I have linked the recording and the powerpoint below:

- [Powerpoint to download](https://purdue0-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/goel36_purdue_edu/EX6L9U8QVTRCn0nGtedw3qoBGJBdS9ufdDINV2yho84J6Q?e=Lzbqlv)
- [Recording on Youtube](https://youtu.be/iejiawY4-kI)

The code we wrote is available in this repository.

I invite you to go check out [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) as they have endless ressources to get started with more JavaScript.

If you're looking for something that resembles a class environment a little bit more, [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) proposes challenges (including a portfolio challenge) to help you master many other web technologies.

Feel free to send me questions if you need any help!
